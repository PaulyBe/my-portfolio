# Paul's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! Here you'll find a collection of my projects, ideas, and experiments in web development, automation, and data visualization. I enjoy building minimalist, user-friendly solutions and sharing my work with others. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you'd like to collaborate!
